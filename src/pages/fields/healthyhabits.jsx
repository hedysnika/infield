          <p>   </p>
          Our bodies are incredibly efficient at adapting to their environment. If we only drink small amounts of water, our bodies will adapt and survive. Our bodies cannot operate at peak performance without sufficient water. Even slight dehydration causes our focus, physical performance, and mood to suffer.
          <br /> <br />
          Poor hydration and water deficits are also potential causes of many diseases. These include chronic pain, digestive stress, migraines, and depression. Cellular hydration is fundamental to human health. Water alone can help treat many illnesses:
  <br /><br />
  <ul className="list-disc">
    <li>
    Allergies: Dehydration over long periods prompts the body to produce histamines to hold on to the water available. Higher histamine levels cause more significant allergic reactions. Antihistamines are effective against allergies.
    </li>
    <li>Headaches: The most common cause of headaches is dehydration. Drinking plenty of water will minimize your risk of getting headaches.
  </li>
    <li>Arthritis: Arthritis is often associated with existing injuries. However, it can also signify that your body is attempting to hold on to the sparing amounts of water left. Therefore, your body is restricting processes that contribute to water loss. One of these is joint movement.
  </li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  Aim to drink between three and four liters of water daily. Start by drinking a big glass of water as soon as you wake up. However, there are many pollutants in tap water. Drinking distilled water with half a teaspoon of unprocessed crystal salt per gallon can purify this water. 
  <br /><br />
  “We use up water as we sleep. First thing in the morning, our tank is low. We need a refill. In fact, the first meal of the day should be water. A liter is a healthy way to start the morning, and if we throw in a pinch of unrefined crystal salt, a pinch of cayenne pepper, and a squirt of fresh lemon juice, we have a great jump start that prepares our digestion, hydrates us, and opens up proper secretions for detoxing.” – Darin Olien Click to Tweet Avoid sodas or coffee as much as possible when tired or moody. A tall glass of water is the better remedy when you feel lethargic. You should also aim to eat as much raw food as possible. Raw food has significantly more water than cooked food and offers better hydration.

  “Keep in mind some veggies actually become healthier when cooked. Tomatoes, when heated, release lycopene, a potent cancer fighter. Carrots, spinach, asparagus, and some mushrooms produce more carotenoids and ferulic acid – both antioxidants – when lightly steamed or slow cooked.” – Darin Olien Click to Tweet Finally, you must consider what type of water you are drinking. Your water may contain chemicals, organic materials, fluoride, chloride, and heavy metals. It is important to consider what is in our water because it is not static. Water constantly travels in and out of our cells, carrying nutrients and messages to the rest of our body. However, water molecules are suspended in electrolytes and must be small enough to fit through our cell membranes. Excess particles and other substances in the water we drink is detrimental to cell functioning.

          <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold"> Alkalization</h1> <br />
          <p>
          Our bodies need a slightly alkaline environment to maintain cell health. The pH scale runs from 0 to 14. 7 represents an equally acidic and alkaline state, 0 is completely acidic, and 14 is completely alkaline. However, this scale is not linear. Instead, each marker on the scale is ten times that of the number next to it. For example, something with a pH of 8 is ten times more alkaline than a pH of 7. Similarly, a pH of 9 is 100 times more alkaline than a pH of 7. Superlife emphasizes this point to showcase how acidic some drinks can be. Water has a pH of 7, while Coca-Cola has a pH of 2.5. Therefore, Coca-Cola is 50,000 times more acidified than distilled water. 
  <br /><br />
  Acidity inflames the body. Specifically, heightened acid levels impact the efficiency of digestive enzymes within the body. Eating mainly acidic foods (cooked and processed) will lead to poor digestion. Alkalization ensures we have all the required minerals in our diet. If we can maintain a slightly alkaline internal state, our cells will effectively support our immune system.
  <br /><br />
  One of the best ways to improve the alkalization of your body is to eat raw foods. Raw foods are naturally more alkaline. However, cooking these foods makes them progressively more acidic, which is bad for our health. Eat raw foods at least once daily.
  <br /><br />
  As with oxygenation, stress will limit the benefits of following these practices. Stress acidifies your body. Similarly, not getting enough sleep has an acidifying effect on the body. Cancerous cells thrive in acidic environments. A list of acidifying foods you should avoid is below:
  <br /><br />
  Aspartame<br />
  Green Bananas <br />
  Barley <br />
  Bran <br />
  Carbonated Beverages <br />
  Cheese <br />
  Chicken <br />
  Cows’ Milk <br />
  Cranberries <br />
  Decaf Coffee <br />
  Duck <br />
  Eggs <br />
  Ketchup <br />
  Lard <br />
  Mayonnaise <br />
  Mustard <br />
  Oat Bran <br />
  Olives <br />
  Palm Kernel Oil <br />
  Peanut Butter <br />
  Pistachios <br />
  Pomegranates <br />
  Rye <br />
  Scallops <br />
  Sugar <br />
  Tapioca <br />
  Turkey <br />
  Avoid nicotine, caffeine, preservatives, additives, industrial chemicals, and alcohol. Each of these is also acidifying.
